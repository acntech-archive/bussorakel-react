    A WARNING YOU WANT TO READ: 
      - This file is a duplicate of public/index.html

    The reason for this is that we're running the webpack-dev-server for development and it expects index.html at the root of it's content-base
    While in production mode, we're serving everythig through express.js and exposing the public folder. So it needs to be there as well.
    For now we need to start both servers to do development, because the webpack-dev-server is using REST endpoints from the express.js server
    by proxying all requests on the /rest path.

    TODO: Stop using webpack-dev-server and use the webpack-middleware for express instead. Then everything will be served from express.
